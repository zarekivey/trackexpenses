## Challenges
### Google Firebase
Before Firebase, I had never worked with any sort of authentication or databases. I had worked with API's, but none were as complex nor required as much attention to detail. I ended up spending a few hours digging through the documentation and testing functions to figure out what features would work best for this application. I settled on logging in with Google and using their Realtime databse because they made the most sense for what I was trying to accomplish for this applcation. My knowledge and confidence with APIs grew after successfully impelementing this API.

### Redux
Though I was familiar wiht React before  entering this project, I had never used Redux or even built a Redux store before. While building this app I had to learn Redux and learn it well enough so that my app would be efficient and work properly. Redux was very challenging at first, but after a while I satyrted to get the hang of it and I learned how important it was. The importance of props vs State was something new to me at the time but I quickly understood why it was a key concept to learn. I now know Redux is essential in just about any Redux application with components that are going to be communicating with each other a lot.

## Notes
- Upon visiting the website, you must login with Google (Firebase API)
- Once inside of the app, click add an exspense
  - You must enter a valid descripton and amount.
  - Notes are optional.
- Once you have expenses set up, you can sort by amount, data, and title.
